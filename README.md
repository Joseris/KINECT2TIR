# KINECT2TIR
Kinect head tracker

Kinect2TIR is a standalone software application that enables real-time head pose tracking with TrackIR supported PC video games.

Utilizing the Kinect's infrared depth data, Kinect2TIR allows accurate tracking in low-light conditions with no headgear or additional equipment required.

It is using the now-deprecated KinectSDK v1. (v2 avalable but not backward compatible)
